# Production Demo System - Test Checklist

## üß™ Comprehensive Testing Guide

This checklist ensures all production features are working correctly before deployment.

### ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Testing

#### 1. Database Connection Test
```bash
# Check database connection
curl http://localhost:3009/api/demo
# Should return API info with status: "operational"
```

#### 2. Form Validation Testing

**Valid Demo Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/api/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Smith", 
    "email": "john.smith@testcorp.com",
    "phone": "+44 7442 852675",
    "company": "Test Petroleum Corp",
    "jobTitle": "Operations Manager",
    "companySize": "51-200",
    "industry": "petroleum-trading",
    "currentSoftware": "Legacy ERP System",
    "challenges": "We need better inventory management and real-time tracking of petroleum deliveries",
    "preferredDate": "2024-02-15",
    "preferredTime": "morning",
    "additionalNotes": "Particularly interested in the Ghana banking integration",
    "consent": true
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Demo request submitted successfully",
  "requestId": "demo_...",
  "data": {
    "id": "...",
    "requestId": "...",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "emailStatus": {
      "customerEmail": "sent",
      "salesEmail": "sent"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting Test
```bash
# Send 6 requests quickly to test rate limiting
for i in {1..6}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/api/demo \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test'$i'@example.com","phone":"+1234567890","company":"Test Corp","jobTitle":"Manager","companySize":"1-50","industry":"petroleum-trading","challenges":"Testing rate limits","preferredDate":"2024-02-15","preferredTime":"morning","consent":true}' \
    -w "Request $i: Status %{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -s
done
```

**Expected:** First 5 requests succeed (200), 6th request fails with 429 (Too Many Requests)

#### 4. Input Validation Tests

**Invalid Email:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/api/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","lastName":"Smith","email":"invalid-email","phone":"+1234567890","company":"Test Corp","jobTitle":"Manager","companySize":"1-50","industry":"petroleum-trading","challenges":"Test invalid email","preferredDate":"2024-02-15","preferredTime":"morning","consent":true}'
```

**Expected:** 400 Bad Request with validation error

**XSS Attempt:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/api/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>","lastName":"Smith","email":"test@example.com","phone":"+1234567890","company":"Test Corp","jobTitle":"Manager","companySize":"1-50","industry":"petroleum-trading","challenges":"Test XSS protection","preferredDate":"2024-02-15","preferredTime":"morning","consent":true}'
```

**Expected:** 400 Bad Request with "Invalid content detected" error

#### 5. Missing Required Fields
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/api/demo \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"John","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

**Expected:** 400 Bad Request with field validation errors
